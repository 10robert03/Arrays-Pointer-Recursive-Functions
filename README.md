# C Pointer & Array Practice

This project is a practical collection of C functions designed to explore and understand the fundamentals of:

- Arrays
- Pointer arithmetic
- Recursion
- Dynamic memory allocation

It serves as a learning playground for experimenting with how data is passed, accessed, and manipulated using pointers and recursive logic.

## Features

The program includes the following:

- `sumArray` â€“ Sum of all array elements  
- `searchElement` â€“ Search for a specific value  
- `findMax`, `findMinMaxByReference` â€“ Find max/min values  
- `calcAvg`, `countAverage` â€“ Average using iteration or recursion  
- `reverseArray` / `reverseArrayRecursive` â€“ In-place reversal  
- `countFrequencyOfElement` â€“ Frequency count of each value  
- `getSecondSmallestNum` â€“ Find second smallest number  
- `findSumValueBF` â€“ Brute force check for two values adding up to a target  
- `findSumValueOptimized` â€“ Two-pointer solution for sorted arrays  
- `isSortedRecursive`, `isSortedBruteForce` â€“ Check if array is sorted  
- `isPalindromeRecursive` â€“ Palindrome check  
- `checkIfOppositeNeighborRecursive` â€“ Check for alternating sign pattern  
- `findAdjacentSum` â€“ Max adjacent pair sum  
- `convertToBinary` â€“ Recursive decimal to binary conversion  
- `isSpecialSort` â€“ Check a float array for a special sorting rule  
- `createArray` â€“ Dynamically allocate and fill an array with user input  
- And more...

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

This project helped me learn and reinforce:

- The relationship between pointers and arrays
- Passing values by reference using pointers
- Recursion as an alternative to iteration
- Using `malloc` and `calloc` for dynamic memory
- Working with memory addresses and function parameters more safely and efficiently
- Building small, testable utility functions in C
